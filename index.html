                  It doesn't, but at the same time it kind of does. Does that
                  sound too cryptic? Click on it and you'll understand (and
                  look at the URL). A simple but effective satire into the

                  nonexistent. Why would you want to do this? Who knows.

                  Who said drug discovery is hard? Just refresh until you
                  find the right chemical. In all seriousness, the fact that
                  this renders a 3D model with the correct bond pairings
                  is impressive.

                  Some of the horses have people on them, but it
                  seems like they're also generated by the GAN since
                  something always seems a bit off with the people.
                  The horses, as always, look great.

                  It's hard enough to tell what news is real and what news isn't with The Onion and the craziness of the
